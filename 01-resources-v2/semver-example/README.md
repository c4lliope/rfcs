# Git Resource v2

This implementation is done in Ruby using the `git` gem. I chose Ruby
over Bash because having a real language with more accessible data
structures is probably going to be more important with this new
interface, and Ruby feels pretty well suited (really just need a bit more
than Bash).

Please leave comments on parts you like/don't like! But bear in mind the
goal here isn't necessarily the prettiness of the code, it's to see what
kinds of things the resource has to do. I'll be using Ruby purely as a
scripting language, hacking things together where needed in the interest
of brevity.
